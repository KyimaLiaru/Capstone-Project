This project aims to implement artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in generating electronic music. The project will focus on generating synthetic music with complex timbres, melodies, and rhythms by utilizing machine learning algorithms such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks, ultimately developing a hybrid AI system that outputs coherent and quality electronic music while addressing some technical challenges faced during the development.

Due to the dataset files being too large, here are the links for downloading the dataset files directly. The dataset used for this project are "Lakh MIDI Datset - Matched" and "Nsynth Dataset".

Being inspired by existing MuseGAN and WaveNet models, this project will be designing simplified versions of the models for suitable training time.
